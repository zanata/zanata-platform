# Merge translations from Translation Memory

TM Merge allows project maintainers to copy translations from TM based on certain criteria. (See below for matching criteria)

## Restrictions

- This feature is only available to project maintainers.
- Only untranslated strings will be changed
- TM Merge translation can only be run if there are no other TM merge operations in progress for the selected version and locale.

1. Check or uncheck different TM selection criteria.
1. If you just want to copy translations from certain project versions, ensure that `Select TM from all projects` is unchecked. Then use the search box to search for projects and add them to the `From Source` section. Adjust project/version order accordingly.
1. Click `Merge Translations` button to start the process.
1. The progress of the merge process is shown by a progress bar on the dialog. You can cancel the process before it finishes.

## Cancel Merge translation
**_Note: This will only stop additional translations being copied. Any translations that have already been copied will remain._**
