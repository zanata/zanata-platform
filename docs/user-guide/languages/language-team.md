A Language Team groups translators together through a common language. Language Teams can work simultaneously on translating a single document into their respective languages. All translations and all revisions are kept with each respective Language Team without affecting any other Team.

Translators can join more than one Language Team.

Translators can also join a [project team](/user-guide/projects/project-team/) so that they can translate that project without having to join the global Language Team.
