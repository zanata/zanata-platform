# Upload Strings

Anyone with an account on Zanata can create a translation project for their strings. The basic steps are:

 1. [Create a project][].
 1. [Create a version][] under the project.
 1. Upload documents to the version:
   - Using the website
   - Using the [command-line client push][] command


[Create a project]: {{ site.url }}/help/projects/create-project
[Create a version]: {{ site.url }}/help/projects/create-version
