* **Run validation** - Allows user to run validations against all documents.

------

1. This will run validation for the documents that are currently visible in the list (if the document list is multiple pages, validation must be run separately for each page).
2. When validation is complete, an icon is shown next to each document name on the page. A check-mark icon means the document did not have any validation warnings. A cross icon and red document name mean one or more translations in the document caused a warning.
3. Click a red document name to see all the translations that caused warnings.

**Note:** validation icons will not change until the next time validation is run on the document, even if the translations are updated. Make sure to re-run validation after making any changes so that the results are accurate.

See [validations](user-guide/projects/validations) for more details.
