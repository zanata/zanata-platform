Copy version is a service that allow project maintainers to create new project version by branching off existing version in the same project.

This saves project maintainer from uploading the same source and translation documents every time a new version is required.

When [creating new version](user-guide/versions/create-version), project maintainer can select if it will be copying from an existing version in the same project.
