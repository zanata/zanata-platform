Translation review can only be performed for a language by users who are reviewers for that language. The language team coordinators for the language decide which users will be reviewers for the language.

## Requesting Review Privileges

You can request to be a reviewer using the [Contact Coordinators](/user-guide/languages/language-team#contact-language-coordinator).

This lets you send a message to the coordinators for the language team, in which you can write a message asking to become a reviewer.
