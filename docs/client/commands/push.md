To upload documents to your project-version, the command-line client's `push` command can be used.

These instructions assume that you have installed Zanata-CLI as shown in [Installing the Client](/client#installation), and have saved user and project configuration as shown in [Configuring the Client](/client/configuration).



## Source Document Upload

The basic command for uploading documents is `zanata-cli push`. The push command should always be run from the directory that contains `zanata.xml` for your project (find information about `zanata.xml` at [Configuring the Client](/client/configuration).

The simplest push command is:

`zanata-cli push`

This command will:

 1. search for source documents in a directory specified as `src-dir` and any of its subdirectories (src-dir can be specified in zanata.xml or from command line option. Default is current directory).
 1. display the current settings and list of source documents that were found.
 1. confirm that you want to proceed with the upload.
 1. upload the located source documents to the server.

*Note:* if your source files are in the same directory as non-source files that have the same extension, such as when using Java `.properties` files for both translation and configuration, the `--includes` or `--excludes` option should be used to tell Zanata which files it should push.

For a full list of the available options for push, run `zanata-cli help push`


## Translation Document Upload

The push command can also upload translations. This is mainly for use when translation has started on your project before it has moved to Zanata. Translators can also use this command to upload translations, although translation on the Zanata website is safer.

To push translations instead of source documents, add the option `--push-type trans`, like so:

```bash
zanata-cli push --push-type trans --trans-dir trans
```

To push source and translation documents together, use `--push-type both`.

These commands will upload all available translations for the locales specified in `zanata.xml`, unless the `-l` or `--locales` option is used to specify a smaller set of locales. For example: `-l ja,de`.

*Note:* translation documents must be named appropriately to match a source document. The appropriate name depends on your project type. For example, if the above command is used for a Java Properties project with a source document `src/strings/messages.properties`, a Japanese translation for the document would be at `trans/strings/messages_ja.properties`.

```bash
src
  strings
    messages.properties
trans
  strings
    messages_ja.properties
```

If you are unsure about the layout and naming for translation files in the selected project type, you can do a trial pull and look at the output. This can be done by copying `zanata.xml` to an empty folder and running a pull command such as:

```bash
zanata-cli pull --src-dir src --trans-dir trans --create-skeletons
```

The option `--create-skeletons` is used to make sure files will be written even if there are no translations.

For more information on the pull command, see [Document Download with Client](/client/commands/pull).
