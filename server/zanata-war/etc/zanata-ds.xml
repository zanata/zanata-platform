<!--
The three transaction types you can use are:

  local-tx-datasource : Identifies a data source that uses transactions, even distributed 
                        transactions within the local application server, but does not use 
                        distributed transactions among multiple application servers.
                        
  no-tx-datasource    : Identifies a data source that does not use transactions. This option is not 
                        shown in the example, but would appear in place of the <local-tx-datasource> 
                        tag. 
  
  xa-datasource       : Identifies a data source that uses distributed transaction among multiple 
                        application servers. This option is not shown in the example, but would 
                        appear in place of the <local-tx-datasource> tag. 
                        
                        So which transaction type should you use? In most cases you will use  
                        <local-tx-datasource> because it handles transactions within a single 
                        application server. If you are clustering your application servers, or want 
                        to use distributed transactions among multiple application servers, then you 
                        should use  <xa-datasource>. Note that both  <local-tx-datasource> and  
                        <xa-datasource> handle distributed transactions which involve multiple 
                        datasources. The difference is that  <local-tx-datasource> handles them only 
                        within a single running application server, while  <xa-datasource> handles 
                        them among many running application servers. On the other end of the 
                        spectrum, if your applications only read from the database, then using 
                        <no-tx-datasource> would be appropriate. 
                        
                        WHAT IS XA? 
                        XA is an API defined by The Open Group's Distributed Transaction Processing 
                        model. This model provides communications mechanisms between a Transaction 
                        Monitor and several resource managers which perform updates against 
                        databases. The Transaction Monitor is responsible for coordinating the 
                        individual transactions handled by the resource managers to ensure 
                        transactional semantics when multiple resource managers are involved in a 
                        single transaction. 

                        
Within the transaction type, you can specify a wide variety of configuration options. The following
describes the various configuration options in the *-ds.xml file. A complete set of configuration 
options, along with a description of each option, can be found in the  docs/dtd/jboss-ds_1_5.dtd file.                         
  
  jndi-name           : The name used to reference the data source in your application configurations. 
                        The name is used to look up the data source in the JNDI namespace. The 
                        "java:" prefix is automatically added to this name, so datasources are not 
                        available outside the virtual machine.
                        
  connection-url      : The database-specific URL to the server.
                        
  driver-class        : The driver you are using for your database.
  
  xa-datasource-class : The class name for the distributed transaction data source. 
                        Valid only for xa-datasource
                        
  user-name           : The username that is defined to access this data source. In general,
                        do not use the root username.
                        
  password            : The password for the corresponding username.
  
  min-pool-size       : The starting pool size for the number of database connections to be allowed 
                        by the application server, default=0. Note that the application server does 
                        not open any connections until the first request for a connection, at which 
                        time it opens this many connections. One way of forcing the connections to be 
                        established when the application server is started is to write a simple 
                        service that does nothing but ask for a connection. 
                        
  max-pool-size       : The maximum number of open connections maintained by the application server,
                        default=20. If the application server runs out of connections, it allocates 
                        a new connection to fulfill that request, until it hits the maximum number of 
                        connections. At that point it queues the requests until connections are freed. 
                        Therefore, it is very important that applications close any connections that 
                        they obtain.
                        NOTE: The max-pool-zize value must not exceed the max-connections porperty
                        value in MySql.
                        
  idle-timeout-minutes: The amount of time before the connection times out.
                        If a surplus connection is not in use for this many minutes, then that 
                        connection is closed. Note that the number of open connections never goes 
                        below the <min-pool-size>, default=0
  blocking-timeout-
  millis              : The amount of time a thread waits on a connection, if all of the connections 
                        are in use and the maximum connections have been allocated. On a timeout 
                        the requestor will gett an exception.
                        
  track-statements    : A Boolean (true/false) that has the data source monitor for unclosed 
                        Statements or ResultSets when the connection is returned to the pool, this 
                        is a debugging feature that should be turned off in production.
                        
  new-connection-sql  : An sql statement that is executed against each new connection. 
                        This can be used to set the connection schema, etc.
  check-valid-
  connection-sql      : Identifies a SQL to be executed when the connection is established to 
                        verify that the connection is valid, e.g. SELECT 1
                        JBoss will run the SQL statement before handing out the connection from 
                        the pool. If the SQL fails, the connection will be destroyed/closed and 
                        new ones will be created. 
                        MySQLValidConnectionChecker is preferred for newer drivers. This will be run 
                        before a managed connection is removed from the pool for use by a client. 
                        See: valid-connection-checker-class-name
  valid-connection-
  checker-class-name  : A class that determines if a connection is valid before it is handed out 
                        from the pool. Should only be used on drivers after 3.22.1 with "ping" 
                        support. The class specified must implement the 
                        org.jboss.resource.adapter.jdbc.ValidConnectionChecker interface. Use this 
                        option instead of check-valid-connection-sql when you want to use more than 
                        a single SQL statement to check the validity of the connection. Be aware 
                        that any application making a connection request that causes a connection to 
                        be established must wait until the connection checker is finished
                        For MySql the class name is:
                        org.jboss.resource.adapter.jdbc.vendor.MySQLValidConnectionChecker
  exception-sorter-
  class-name          : Identifies a class used to determine if an error number returned by the 
                        database is fatal. For MySql the class name is:
                        org.jboss.resource.adapter.jdbc.vendor.MySQLExceptionSorter
                        
  type-mapping        : Used by the container-managed persistence (CMP) code to identify the 
                        database and adjust its database handling accordingly. The name use 
                        must match one of the names in the standardjbosscmp-jdbc.xml file. 
                        Additionally, you can add new entries to the standardjbosscmp-jdbc.xml 
                        to customize the database interaction. 
                        NOTE that this is used ONLY for EJB 2.1, NOT for EJB 3.
                        
  config-property:      Identifies a property to pass to the java.sql.Driver when establishing a 
                        database connection. Refer to the documentation for your JDBC driver for the 
                        valid properties. You can provide multiple config-property entries. Valid 
                        only for local-tx-datasource and no-tx-datasource.    
  xa-datasource-
  property            : Identifies a property to pass to the javax.sql.DataSource when establishing 
                        a database connection. Refer to the documentation for the JDBC driver for 
                        the valid properties. You can provide multiple xa-datasource-property 
                        entries. Valid only for xa-datasource.                        
  prepared-statement-
  cache-size          : The number of prepared statements to hold in the cache, default=0
  
  share-prepared-
  statements          : If a request creates the same prepared statement more than once in a
                        given request, should the same prepared statement object be used. Note
                        that reusing the prepared statement in this case could cause the
                        application to get unintended results if the application requested the result
                        set from the first prepared statement after creating the second prepared
                        statement, default=false
  transaction-
  isolation           : Specifies the java.sql.Connection transaction isolation level to use,
                        unspecified means use the default provided by the database. 
                        The constants defined in the Connection interface are the possible element 
                        content values and include:
                          TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED
                          TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED
                          TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ
                          TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE
                          TRANSACTION_NONE
                          
                        Refer to your database JDBC documentation for a description of each level 
                        and which levels your database supports.
                        
  Notes for MySql:
  * Use UTF8 charset when creating the database:
      CREATE DATABASE my_database CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci DEFAULT CHARSET utf8;
    
  * Use InnoDb for tables
      In persistence.xml add this property for hbm2ddl: 
      <property name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect"/>
      
      or if you creates the tables by writing the SQL DDL by hand (you little machocist:):
        CREATE TABLE `my_database`.`my_table` (
          `id` INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
          `text` VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
          PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
        ) ENGINE = InnoDB;


    MySql example:
    
    <local-tx-datasource>

        <jndi-name>seam-refimplDatasource</jndi-name>
        <connection-url>jdbc:mysql://localhost/refimpl_db?characterEncoding=UTF-8</connection-url>
        <driver-class>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</driver-class>
        <user-name>root</user-name>
        <password></password>

        <min-pool-size>20</min-pool-size>

        // Make sure your MySQL config has that many max_connections!
             This is the max_threads in default Tomcat server.xml on JBoss AS. //
        <max-pool-size>250</max-pool-size>

        <blocking-timeout-millis>5000</blocking-timeout-millis>

        // Needs to be smaller than wait_timeout (which is in seconds) in /etc/my.cnf! //
        <idle-timeout-minutes>2</idle-timeout-minutes>

        // These are the secret ingredients that make it stable! A simple check-valid-connection-sql won't be enough! //
