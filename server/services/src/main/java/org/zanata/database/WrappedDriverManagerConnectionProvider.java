/**
 * Modified version of DriverManagerConnectionProviderImpl which adds support
 * for JBDC wrapping. This Hibernate ConnectionProvider is used, in unit
 * tests, to simulate MySQL's support for streaming ResultSets, by allowing
 * fetchSize=Integer.MIN_VALUE (which H2 rejects) and by detecting violations
 * of MySQL's streaming ResultSet limitations (ie attempts to perform other
 * queries while a streaming ResultSet is open).
 * <p>
 * NB: this class uses the internal Hibernate class DriverManagerConnectionProviderImpl.
 * When Hibernate is updated, this ConnectionProvider may need to be updated
 * (eg to use a new class name, to implement new interfaces) or removed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The delegation approach used in WrappedDatasourceConnectionProvider would
 * allow support for multiple Hibernate versions, but we only use a single
 * version of Hibernate when running unit tests, so it's probably not worth it.
 * </p>
