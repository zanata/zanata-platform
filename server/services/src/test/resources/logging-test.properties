# register SLF4JBridgeHandler as handler for the j.u.l. root logger
handlers = org.slf4j.bridge.SLF4JBridgeHandler

# Note that JUL log messages which don't pass the JUL level threshold will *not* be sent to SLF4J
# even if the corresponding log4j category is enabled, because we can't use LevelChangePropagator
# (unless we switch to logback for unit tests).
# So you may need to enable some logging categories here as well as in log4j.xml.
