# ES Next

ES6/ES2015 and increasingly ES7/ES2016 code can be used (and is preferred)
throughout the front-end. It is compiled using Babel during the build into
browser compatible javascript.

Here are some ES Next features used extensively throughout the code:

- Module import/exports
- Rest/Spread
- Arrow function
